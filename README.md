# Transformer networks for Neural Machine Translation

This is an implementation of the transformer for the paper

["Attention is all you need"](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf)

It also contains the implementation of the Speech Transformer as in

["Very Deep Self-Attention Networks for End-to-End Speech Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13377)

----------------------------

Recipe for the Speech model coming soon.
